Denote
- $\mathcal S = ùîΩ_2[z]$ as the ring of binary polynomials
- $\mathcal S^n$ as the set of polynomials in $\mathcal S$ that has degree no more than $n$, in particular, $\mathcal S^1 = \{0, 1, z, z+1\}$

###Problems
1.
    **Probability of sigularity**
    Denote $\Pr(n)$ as the probaility of the presense of a zero determinant matrix, uniformly randomly selected from the set of all $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathcal S$ (or even in $\{0, 1, z\}$). Characterize the probaility, show it converges to $1$ quickly.

    **Fact** $10^4$ simulation shows the above is true.

    **Conjucture**
    $$\Pr(n) = (\frac{1}{4} + o(1))^n$$

2.  **Fast determinant** Fast approach to find (or detect if is $0$) the determinant of a square matrix with entries in $\mathcal S^1$.

    **Quasi-Gaussian** Notice any row operation (addition) or row (column) permutation does not change the determinant of such matrices. Hence for a matrix $M$, we can reduce it to the form
    $$\pmatrix{1 & 0 & 0 & \dots \\ z & 0 & 0  & \dots \\ & 1 & 0 & \dots \\ & z & 0 & \dots \\ \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots}$$
    where the trapezoid above $1, z$ is all 0. Now by row, column permutations, $M$ can be reduced to
    $$\pmatrix{D_1 & \times \\ zD_2 & \times}$$
    where $D_i$ is any binary diagonal matrix hence $\det D_i = 0$ if the diagonal is not all $1$. Similarly now column operation will reduce the lower left corner into a binary permutation matrix, i.e. a binay matrix that has at most one $1$ on each row. Then
    $$\det M = \det \pmatrix{D_1 & \times \\ zD_2 & P}$$

3. Denote $\Pr_M(n)$ as the probability of the presense of an non-MDS matrix when uniformly selected from the set of all $n \times n$ matrices having their entries in $\mathcal S^1$. Characterize the probability and show it is bounded above.
